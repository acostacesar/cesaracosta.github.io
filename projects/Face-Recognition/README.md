## Face Recognition Application 
### Implemented in python, OpenCV, tensorflow, Keras
- Using transfer learning, achieved extremely high test accuracy for a small training
data set with no external preprocessing
- Successfully developed a method to detect and recognize faces for arbitrary pictures
with multiple faces, as well as tilted face
- Explored direct training, pretraining using LFW with simple CNN and MobileNet, as
well as VGGFace
- Developed and compared CNNs implemented in both tensorflow and Keras
